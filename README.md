# DS-Village-Calculator

This projects primary purpose is to be a coding challenge for myself.
The goal is to create a script, for the game "Tribal Wars" ("Die St√§mme" in german),
which predicts the possible states of a village which is described by its point 
increases.

Since there are 14 buildings with 3 to 30 possible building levels each, there
are way too many possible game states to just brute-force it (at least if the script
should compile at a reasonable time with a reasonable amount of resources).
But since I currently participate in a course for big data processing and one for
parallel computing in the cloud, I will try to use this script to practice newly
learned methods and increase how far it is executable on my notebook (which is
neither a proper tool for big data nor for cloud computing but rather sets limits
to force myself to improve the scripts' efficiency).

Another beneficiary side effect for me is, that I found a project for practicing
go.
